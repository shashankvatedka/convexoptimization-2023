* Basic python 
The following exercises will require some more concepts than those covered in the videos (e.g., how to read files, and how to take user inputs).
  - Write a program to compute the n'th number in the Fibonacci sequence (using recursion)
  - Write a program to compute the binomial coefficient (using functions and recursion)
  - Write a program to open a text file, and compute the frequency of occurrence of each of the characters in the english alphabet
  - Write a function that does the following: given a string, and a text file as input, output the number of occurrences of the string within the file.
  - Write a program to implement a 2-player [[https://playtictactoe.org/][tic-tac-toe]] game (by taking user inputs) 

* Numpy and matplotlib
